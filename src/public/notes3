On top of the geographical aspect about who takes what and where each alliance start I heard from many people that this event reward servers with a single alliance btw i don't agree 100% with that, I try to explain.

Imo a single alliance is best when there's a confined war with a single objective like a KvK or the palace fight where we shined.

During a "prolonged war" scenario where the most important thing is to fill enemy hospital and slowly drain their troops avaibility.
I think that the best way for doing that is having 2 alliances that can fill a 2M t7 rally for outnumber the enemy in a "divide et impera" way.
What i mean is, except for the first 1/2 days where we can rush solo for the first buffs, we should move the flags together side by side touching enemy flags together; there's plenty of time and rss for doing that.

Once the alliances are balanced in terms of power/troops type/timezone there's not a preferable target for enemy and we can see the different possible scenarios:

1 - Attacking a flag/city/tower: 
With a single alliance with the field or without that u will end in a rally vs refill rally+counter rally situation with a 2M vs 4M(2M main vs 2M main and 2M secondary); having 2 alliances let u attack the flag with 2 rallies vs 1 refill rally + 2 couter rallies; the ratio drops from 1:2 to 2:3 (4M main vs 2M main+2M second+2M tertiary);

2 - Defending a flag/city/tower:
as opposite of the scenario of before here we have a refil rally+2counter rallies vs a rally so 3:1 ratio (4M main+2M secondary vs 2M main).
Having the power balanced between alliances enable u to have whales on both sides and to put towers for helping whales cut their refills(there's no need of all whales on field; better a small group of the defending alliance and enemies march slowed down);

3 - Contested "next flag":
when enemy flags are close we MUST purple tp around the the next flags and take best positions and make a "castle hop" connection in case they build faster the flag.

When enemy attack a flag of ours the flag should be empty; it's not important the flag, the important thing is the kill/hospital ratio we have.
We need to EVER sync the ralies for letting them lose the more as possible and keep the ratio the more on our side as possible.
The main goal is to let their rallies/reinforcements weak and than we can cut them like butter.

Than during palace war we can fill a single alliance for a best refill since we can't retreat with the goal of draining them.

Idk if i explained my point well, I hope to didn't hurt anybody lol just wanna share my opinion about what i saw and what i think is best for the server even said that the balancing thing require a lot of work but in the end this is what the peace enable u to do with some work done before.

On top of this we should train people to use machinery; lead a rally; make better open-field and rally lineups; making a group with rally leaders for sync their rallies ecc. ecc.

I could be completely wrong, would love to see other opinions too :D



Btw "nobody  would know what would happen"....... there's videos and aoem official posts since April LMAO and on top of that the thing is pretty clear...go to Z2, take cities and towers, go to Z3, take palace lol not so complex, just need to know how to handle war and that's what we handled badly, 107 is used to plan everything slowly and in a detailed manner while war needs simple goals and duties and a spirit of adaptation in real time. This event reward the ones who can handle the moment
Andrew and the others keeps saying that this event rewards u if u're a single alliance and I'm so much in contrast with this opinion that I don't even know where to start lol
All the war tactics is about 5 scenarios

1-attacking a flag
2-defending a flag
3-attacking a city/tower
4-defending a city/tower
5-contested terrain positioning
1-the enemy will have a fast refill, even if u have krakens they will refill fast cause u have no time for clicking on the troop; if u have the field u can refill fast and if u don't u need ur castles on the opposite side for taxi rally; when defending they can counter ur rally so this is a 2M vs 4M situation.

Having 2 alliances can let u attack the flag with a 4M vs 6M, the ratio drops from 1:2 to 2:3
And ur 4M are all main troops while their 6M are main, secondary and tertiary
2 alliances will win
2-when defending u need to place towers for slowing down their refills and counter their rally, as opposite of the scenario of before here we have a 6M vs 2M so 3:1 ratio for us
with 4M of main marches and 2M of secondary
2 alliance will win
And that's why we was able to defense and not to attack(even said our main rally was with secondary marches due to full hospital of the war before) but u can also attack their flags while defending with 4M  (2M of secondary march of the supporting alliance + 2M of third march) but it needs both the alliances moving flags together as once 
We was struggling also cause Andrew asked to remove the towers but piolo and other whales can't cut their refills, the support alliance shouldn't stay on field but Andrew thinks he's the main character ever in the battle
3 and 4- are like 1 and 2 but the field here play a more central role
5-when u're close to enemy u MUST purple tp around the flag next to urs so when they build u've better positions for a fast rally refill while they doesn't anymore so u can contrast better the difficulties of attacking a flag
And when they outnumber the rally DISBAND lol Andrew never disbanded his rallies until are destroyed, 1 man should manage rallies and have r4 position for taking people outside and choose the troops and if needed involving autotroops when defending
In every situation the more alliances the best it is
Need to balance the alliance, people from TSS should have gone to hel and not viceversa
Need to clash with the more people possible together and SYNC the rallies, not spamming randomly, when the alliance attack the flag MUST be empty and sync 3 rallies together: 1 flag reinf and 2 counter rallies that clash together their rally even if they take down the flag after some rallies in 3/4 hrs of fight they will have 0 troops and than u can cut them like butter
In cities there's many tactics like the first city I placed an escalade for letting whales inside; made a fake rally on the filled gate while the main one was on another gate so when they moved from one gate to another for filling our whales killed them in mass lol
Btw TL;DR the more alliances that can fill a 2M T7 rally the better it is cause the focus is that u need to clash enemy with the more troops at possible in sync, having only one alliance is the worst thing u can do but it looks like that is the plan lol
The work we should do from now on should be to balance the more as we can the alliances in terms of power and of the kind of main troops; than change the leadership and start to instruct players about how to make good lineups ecc ecc but Andrew thinks that the only problem are players not filling lol
